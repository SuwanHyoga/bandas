		It starts with</br>
		One thing, I don't know why</br>
		It doesn't even matter how hard you try</br>
		Keep that in mind</br>
		I designed this rhyme to explain in due time</br>
		All I know</br>
		Time is a valuable thing</br>
		Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings</br>
		Watch it count down to the end of the day</br>
		The clock ticks life away</br>
		It's so unreal</br>
		Didn't look out below</br>
		Watch the time go right out the window</br>
		Trying to hold on, but didn't even know</br>
		I wasted it all</br>
		just to watch you go</br>
		I kept everything inside</br>
		And even though I tried</br>
		It all fell apart</br>
		What it meant to me will eventually be a</br>
		memory of a time when</br>
		</br>
		I tried so hard and got so far</br>
		But in the end, it doesn't even matter</br>
		I had to fall to lose it all</br>
		But in the end it doesn't even matter</br>
		</br>
		One thing, I don't know why</br>
		It doesn't even matter how hard you try</br>
		Keep that in mind i designed this rhyme to remind myself how</br>
		I tried so hard</br>
		In spite of the way you were mocking me</br>
		Acting like I was part of your property</br>
		Remembering all the times you fought with me</br>
		I'm surprised it got so [far]</br>
		Things aren't the way they were before</br>
		You wouldn't even recognize me anymore</br>
		Not that you knew me back then</br>
		But it all comes back to me [in the end]</br>
		I kept everything inside</br>
		And even though I tried</br>
		It all fell apart</br>
		What it meant to me will eventually be a</br>
		memory of a time when</br>
		</br>
		I tried so hard and got so far</br>
		But in the end, it doesn't even matter</br>
		I had to fall to lose it all</br>
		But in the end it doesn't even matter</br>
		</br>
		I've put my trust in you</br>
		Pushed as far as I can go</br>
		for all this</br>
		There's only one thing you should know</br>
		</br>
		I've put my trust in you</br>
